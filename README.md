# WeasyPrint 53.1 and 53.2 possible issue
This repository contains a simple HTML file:

```html
<p>Image follows:</p>
<img src="pngtest8rgba.png"/>
```

Which when converted using `weasyprint in.html out.pdf` creates:
- [out-53.0.pdf](out-53.0.pdf) when converted using WeasyPrint 53.0 - WORKING
- [out-53.1.pdf](out-53.1.pdf) when converted using WeasyPrint 53.1 - BROKEN
- [out-53.2.pdf](out-53.2.pdf) when converted using WeasyPrint 53.2 - BROKEN

What BROKEN means here:

- The image is not rendered when viewed in macOS Preview (checked Version 11.0 (1018.6.2)) or in Acrobat (, which also pops up a `There was an error processing a page` dialog).
- The image is rendered by the built in Chrome PDF viewer, and the GitHub PDF viewer (perhaps due to other error handling)?

A check using qpdf shows the below output (similar output for both 53.1 and 53.2):
```sh
$ qpdf --check out-53.2.pdf
